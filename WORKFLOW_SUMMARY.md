# Quarto to Jekyll Workflow Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Created a Markdown-Only Rendering Workflow**:
   - Modified `_quarto.yml` to output GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) instead of HTML
   - Configured the output to preserve YAML front matter for Jekyll compatibility
   - Set up proper code execution to include results in the markdown output

2. **Developed Helper Scripts**:
   - `render_to_markdown.sh`: Renders Quarto documents to markdown with code execution
   - `install_dependencies.R`: Installs required R packages for blog posts

3. **Created Documentation**:
   - `MARKDOWN_WORKFLOW.md`: Details of the new workflow
   - `JEKYLL_INTEGRATION.md`: Instructions for using the markdown in Jekyll
   - Updated the main README with information about the new workflow

## How It Works

1. The rendering process:
   - Executes all code in R markdown chunks
   - Captures outputs, plots, and tables
   - Preserves the directory structure of posts
   - Maintains all assets (images, etc.)
   - Outputs markdown files that are ready for Jekyll

2. The Jekyll integration:
   - The markdown files can be used directly in a Jekyll site
   - Front matter is preserved for Jekyll's use
   - Image paths are maintained for proper rendering

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Quarto handles code execution and content generation
   - Jekyll handles HTML rendering and website styling
   - This makes it easier to change either component independently

2. **Flexibility**:
   - You can update the Jekyll theme without affecting the Quarto setup
   - You can update Quarto or R packages without changing the Jekyll site

3. **Improved Workflow**:
   - Local rendering makes debugging easier
   - You can check the exact markdown output before using it in Jekyll
   - Reduces CI/CD complexity by splitting the process

## Next Steps

1. Finish the rendering process and verify all files are generated correctly
2. Set up the Jekyll site to use the generated markdown files
3. Consider automating the process to update the Jekyll site when new content is added
