seasonal is an easy-to-use and full-featured R-interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS,
the seasonal adjustment software developed by the United States Census
Bureau.
The latest CRAN version of seasonal makes it much easier to adjust multiple time series.

[seasonal](http://www.seasonal.website) depends on the [x13binary](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=x13binary) package to access pre-built
binaries of X-13ARIMA-SEATS on all platforms and does not require any manual
installation. To install both packages:

```r
install.packages("seasonal")
```

`seas` is the core function of the [seasonal](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seasonal) package. By default, `seas` calls
the automatic procedures of X-13ARIMA-SEATS to perform a seasonal adjustment
that works well in most circumstances:

```r
seas(AirPassengers)
```

For a more detailed introduction, read our [article in the *Journal of
Statistical Software*](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v087.i11).

### Multiple Series Adjusmtent

In the latest [CRAN version 1.8](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seasonal), it is now possible to seasonally adjust multiple series in a single call to `seas()`.
This is done by using the built-in batch mode of X-13. It removes the need for loops or `lapply()` in such cases and finally brings one missing feature of X-13 to seasonal -- the *composite* spec.

Multiple adjustments can be performed by supplying multiple time series as an
`"mts"` object:

```{r}
library(seasonal)
m <- seas(cbind(fdeaths, mdeaths), x11 = "")
final(m)
```

This will perform two seasonal adjustments, one for `fdeaths` and one for
`mdeaths`. X-13 spec-argument combinations can be applied in the usual way, such
as `x11 = ""`. Note that if entered that way, they will apply to both series. The [vignette on multiple adjustments](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seasonal/vignettes/multiple.html) describes how to specify options for individual series.


### Backend

X-13 ships with a batch mode that allows multiple adjustments in a single call
to X-13. This is now the default in seasonal (`multimode = "x13"`).
Alternatively, X-13 can be called for each series (`multimode = "R"`).
The results should be usually the same, but switching to
`multimode = "R"` may be useful for debugging:

```{r}
seas(cbind(fdeaths, mdeaths), multimode = "x13")
seas(cbind(fdeaths, mdeaths), multimode = "R")
```

In general, `multimode = "x13"` is faster. The following comparison on a MacBook Pro shows
a modest speed gain, but bigger differences have been observed on other systems:

```r
many <- rep(list(fdeaths), 100)
system.time(seas(many, multimode = "x13"))
#   user  system elapsed
#  9.415   0.653  10.079
system.time(seas(many, multimode = "R"))
#   user  system elapsed
# 11.130   1.039  12.324
```

### composite spec

Support for the X-13 batch mode makes it finally possible to use the *composite*
spec -- the one feature of X-13 that was missing in seasonal. Sometimes, one has to decide whether
seasonal adjustment should be performed on a granular level or on an aggregated
level. The *composite* spec helps you to analyze the problem and to compare the
direct and the indirect adjustments.

The `composite` argument is a list with an X-13 specification that is applied on
the aggregated series. Specification works identically for other series in
`seas()`, including the application of the defaults. If you provide an empty
list, the usual defaults of `seas()` are used.
A minimal composite call looks like this:

```{r}
seas(
  cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths),
  composite = list(),
  series.comptype = "add"
)
```

You can verify that the composite refers to the total of `mdeaths` and `fdeaths` by running:

```{r}
seas(ldeaths)
```

where `ldeaths` is the sum of `mdeaths` and `fdeaths`.
