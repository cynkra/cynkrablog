We are happy to announce that the latest [CRAN version](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seasonal) of *seasonal* fixes several bugs and makes it easier to read specialized output from X-13ARIMA-SEATS. See [here](https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal/blob/main/NEWS.md#110) for a complete list of changes. In addition, the accompanying *seasonalview* package has been [updated](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seasonalview) and finally gets rid of some annoying warning messages.


## What is seasonal adjustment?

Time series data often display recurring seasonal patterns throughout the year. For instance, unemployment rates in the United States typically rise from January to March and again in June and July. By applying seasonal adjustment, analysts can identify and remove these predictable annual patterns, allowing for clearer interpretation of fundamental changes in the data. The R package *seasonal* provides a powerful and user-friendly way to perform this task in R, leveraging the X-13ARIMA-SEATS procedure developed by the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/software/x13as.X-13ARIMA-SEATS.html).


## Getting started in R

To get started, use the `seas` function on any time series:

```{r}
library(seasonal)
m <- seas(AirPassengers)
summary(m)
```

By default, `seas` calls the automatic procedures of X-13ARIMA-SEATS to perform a seasonal adjustment that works well in most circumstances.

To extract the final series, use the `final()` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
final(m)  
```

To plot the results, use the `plot()` function:

```{r}
plot(m)  
```

## Input and output

In *seasonal*, it is possible to use the complete syntax of
X-13ARIMA-SEATS. The X-13ARIMA-SEATS syntax uses *specs* and *arguments*, with each spec
optionally containing some arguments. For
example, in order to set the 'variables' argument of the 'regression' spec equal
to `td` and `ao1999.jan`, the input to `seas` can be specified like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
m <- seas(AirPassengers, regression.variables = c("td", "ao1955.jan"))
```

*seasonal* has a flexible mechanism to read data from X-13ARIMA-SEATS. With the
`series` function, it is possible to extract any output that can be
generated by X-13ARIMA-SEATS. For example, the following command returns the
forecasts of the ARIMA model as a time series:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
m <- seas(AirPassengers)
series(m, "forecast.forecasts")
```


## Graphical user interface

The *seasonalview* package provides a graphical user interface to explore the results of the seasonal adjustment. Use the `view()` function to open it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
view(m)
```

This interface allows for interactive exploration and adjustment of seasonal models, making it easier to fine-tune your seasonal adjustments and visualize the results.
