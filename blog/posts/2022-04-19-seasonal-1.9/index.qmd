seasonal is an easy-to-use and full-featured R interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS,
the seasonal adjustment software developed by the United States Census
Bureau.
The latest CRAN version of seasonal fixes several bugs and makes it easier to access output from multiple objects. See [here](https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal/blob/main/NEWS.md#190) for a complete list of changes.

`seas()` is the core function of the [seasonal](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seasonal) package. By default, `seas()` calls
the automatic procedures of X-13ARIMA-SEATS to perform a seasonal adjustment
that works well in most circumstances:

```r
library(seasonal)
seas(AirPassengers)
```

For a more detailed introduction, read our [article in the *Journal of
Statistical Software*](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v087.i11).

### Multiple series adjustment

The previous version has introduced [the adjustment of multiple series](https://www.cynkra.com/blog/2021-03-09-seasonal-1.8/) in a single call to `seas()`. This has removed the need for loops or `lapply()` in such cases and finally brought the *composite* spec to seasonal.

As [Brian Monsell](https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal/issues/278) pointed out, this was not enough to access the output from the composite spec. The latest  [CRAN version](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seasonal) fixes this problem.

Multiple adjustments can be performed by supplying multiple time series as an `"mts"` object:

```{r}
library(seasonal)
m0 <- seas(cbind(fdeaths, mdeaths), x11 = "")
final(m0)
```

This performs two seasonal adjustments, one for `fdeaths` and one for `mdeaths`. The [vignette on multiple adjustments](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seasonal/vignettes/multiple.html) describes how to specify options for individual series.

### Accessing composite output

The `composite` argument is a list with an X-13 specification applied to the aggregated series:

```{r}
m1 <- seas(
  cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths),
  composite = list(),
  series.comptype = "add"
)
```

With version 1.9 can now use `out()` to access the output of the composite spec:

```r
out(m1)
```

We can also use `series()`, e.g., to access the final, indirectly adjusted series via the `composite` spec (see `?series` for all available series):


```{r}
series(m1, "composite.indseasadj")
```
