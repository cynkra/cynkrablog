See [here](https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal/blob/main/NEWS.md#110) for a complete list of changes. In addition, the accompanying *seasonalview* package has been [updated](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seasonalview) and finally gets rid of some annoying warning messages.\n\n\n## What is seasonal adjustment?\n\nTime series data often display recurring seasonal patterns throughout the year. For instance, unemployment rates in the United States typically rise from January to March and again in June and July. By applying seasonal adjustment, analysts can identify and remove these predictable annual patterns, allowing for clearer interpretation of fundamental changes in the data. The R package *seasonal* provides a powerful and user-friendly way to perform this task in R, leveraging the X-13ARIMA-SEATS procedure developed by the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/software/x13as.X-13ARIMA-SEATS.html).\n\n\n## Getting started in R\n\nTo get started, use the `seas` function on any time series:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(seasonal)\nm <- seas(AirPassengers)\nsummary(m)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nseas(x = AirPassengers)\n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    \nWeekday           -0.0029497  0.0005232  -5.638 1.72e-08 ***\nEaster[1]          0.0177674  0.0071580   2.482   0.0131 *  \nAO1951.May         0.1001558  0.0204387   4.900 9.57e-07 ***\nMA-Nonseasonal-01  0.1156204  0.0858588   1.347   0.1781    \nMA-Seasonal-12     0.4973600  0.0774677   6.420 1.36e-10 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nSEATS adj.  ARIMA: (0 1 1)(0 1 1)  Obs.: 144  Transform: log\nAICc: 947.3, BIC: 963.9  QS (no seasonality in final):    0  \nBox-Ljung (no autocorr.): 26.65   Shapiro (normality): 0.9908  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBy default, `seas` calls the automatic procedures of X-13ARIMA-SEATS to perform a seasonal adjustment that works well in most circumstances.\n\nTo extract the final series, use the `final()` function:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfinal(m)  \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nTo plot the results, use the `plot()` function:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(m)  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Input and output\n\nIn *seasonal*, it is possible to use the complete syntax of\nX-13ARIMA-SEATS. The X-13ARIMA-SEATS syntax uses *specs* and *arguments*, with each spec\noptionally containing some arguments. For\nexample, in order to set the 'variables' argument of the 'regression' spec equal\nto `td` and `ao1999.jan`, the input to `seas` can be specified like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm <- seas(AirPassengers, regression.variables = c(\"td\", \"ao1955.jan\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n*seasonal* has a flexible mechanism to read data from X-13ARIMA-SEATS. With the\n`series` function, it is possible to extract any output that can be\ngenerated by X-13ARIMA-SEATS. For example, the following command returns the\nforecasts of the ARIMA model as a time series:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm <- seas(AirPassengers)\nseries(m, \"forecast.forecasts\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Graphical user interface\n\nThe *seasonalview* package provides a graphical user interface to explore the results of the seasonal adjustment. Use the `view()` function to open it:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nview(m)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n![Seasonalview GUI](seasonalview.png)\n\nThis interface allows for interactive exploration and adjustment of seasonal models, making it easier to fine-tune your seasonal adjustments and visualize the results.\n\n\n## More information\n\nFor a more detailed introduction, check our [article in the *Journal of Statistical Software*](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v087.i11) or visit [the package website](http://www.seasonal.website). The package website also allows you to upload your own data and explore the results interactively.\n\nYou can report bugs, ask questions, or contribute to the development on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/christophsax/seasonal). Thanks for using *seasonal*!\n\n\n",
